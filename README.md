This repository contains a Hack program that demonstrates a stack overflow error in a recursive function. The program calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. When the input number is large, the function will call itself many times, leading to a stack overflow error. The solution demonstrates how to avoid the stack overflow error by using iteration instead of recursion.
